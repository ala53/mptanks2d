Getting started
===============

To launch the development server do the following:

	a) Launch the Visual Studio 2010 Solution => "Serverside Code.VS2010.sln"

	b) Press F5. This should start the development server.
	   If a windows Firewall dialog pops up, press allow.
	
To launch the client .swf file do the following
	
	a) Open the MyGame.fla file from the Flash folder

	b) Put your gameid into the Flash/MyGame.as file where it says "[Enter your game id here]"
		If you don't have a gameid, simply login into the player.io admin dashboard
		and click "create game".

	c) Press ctrl-enter inside flash to launch the client .swf file.

If all goes well, you should see the client connect to the development
server in both the client and the development server window.
